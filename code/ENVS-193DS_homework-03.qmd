# Problem 1. Personal Data

## a. Summarizing data

For my project, I am testing to see if the type of swimming workout that I do, each with different yardages and levels of intensity, influences the average amount of sleep I get per night. I am comparing the mean between groups, and I believe that more intense workouts will cause me to sleep more.

## b. Visualization

```{r cleaning data}
personal_data_clean <- read.csv("data/updated_personal_data.csv") |> # start with updated_personal_data data frame
  clean_names() # clean up the column names
```
