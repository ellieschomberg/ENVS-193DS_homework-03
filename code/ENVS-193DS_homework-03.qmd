# Problem 1. Personal Data

## a. Summarizing data

For my project, I am testing to see if the type of swimming workout that I do, each with different yardages and levels of intensity, influences the average amount of sleep I get per night. I am comparing the mean between groups, and I believe that more intense workouts will cause me to sleep more.

## b. Visualization

```{r cleaning data}
personal_data_clean <- read.csv(here("data", "updated_personal_data.csv")) |> # start with updated_personal_data data frame
  clean_names() # clean up the column names
```

```{r summarizing data}
personal_data_summary <- personal_data_clean |> # start with personal_data_clean dataframe
  group_by(type_of_workout) |>  #grouping by type of workout
  summarize(mean = mean(amount_of_sleep_hours), # calculating mean
            n = length(amount_of_sleep_hours), # counting the number of observations
            df = n -1, # calculating the degrees of freedom
            sd = sd(amount_of_sleep_hours), # calculating the standard deviation
            se = sd/sqrt(n), # calculating the standard error
            tval = qt(p = 0.05/2, df = df, lower.tail = FALSE), # finding the t value
            margin = tval*se, # calculating the margin of error
            ci_lower = mean - tval*se, # calculating the lower bound of the CI
            ci_upper = mean + tval*se) # calculating the upper bound of the CI
```

```{r jitterplot}
ggplot(data = personal_data_clean, # starting with personal_data_clean data frame
       aes(x = type_of_workout, # x axis is type of workout
           y = amount_of_sleep_hours, # y axis is amount of sleep

                    ymax = mean + se,
                    color = type_of_workout), # color by type of workout
                width = 0.1, # changing the width
                inherit.aes = FALSE) + # making sure it changes axis from the first layer
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Aerobic" = "midnightblue", "200 Free" = "mediumvioletred", "500 Free" = "cyan4", "1650 Free" = "steelblue4", "Racing" = "seagreen")) + # changing colors from the default
  labs(x = "Type of Workout", # renaming axis
       y = "Amount of Sleep (hours)",
       title = "Average Sleep and Swimming Workouts", # adding title
       color = "Type of Workout") +
  theme(panel.background = element_blank(), # getting rid of background
        axis.line = element_blank(), # getting rid of lines and ticks
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),

## c. Caption

**Figure 1. Type of swimming workout completed compared to average sleep.**
Points represent observations of individual nights of sleep after completing a specific type of swimming workout (total n = 23). Colors represent the different types of workouts (Dark blue = Aerobic, Magenta = 200 Free, Teal = 500 Free, Light blue = 1650 Free, Green = Racing). Bold points represent the mean amount of sleep in hours for each type of workout, and the bars represent the standard error around the mean.

## d. Table presentation

```{r tbale}
table_input <- head(personal_data_summary) %>% 
  select(type_of_workout, mean, sd, se, ci_lower, ci_upper) %>%
  mutate(mean = round(mean, 1),
         sd = round(sd, 1),
         se = round(se, 1),
         ci_lower = round(ci_lower, 1),
         ci_upper = round(ci_upper, 1)) %>%
  rename("Type of Workout" = type_of_workout,
         "Mean" = mean,
         "Standard Deviation" = sd,
         "Standard Error" = se,
         "CI Lower Bound" = ci_lower,
         "CI Upper Bound" = ci_upper)

# Problem 2. Affective Visualization

## a. Describe in words what an affective visualization could look like for your personal data

Since I am comparing the type of swimming workout I do to the amount of hours I sleep, I thought it would be really cool to try and make the background look like a pool, and have the bold points for the means look like a swimmer. The different types of workouts each have different ranges of yardages, some longer and some shorter. I think if I can do it, it would be really cool to make my plot look like a pool, where the swimmers appear to be "racing", and each swimmer in their "lane" is one of the different workout categories. It looks like they are different lengths across the pool, and those points represent the mean amount of sleep I calculated for each of the different workouts.

## b. Create a sketch of your idea

## c. Make a draft of your visualization



## d. Write an artist statement

In my piece, I am showing how the type of swimming workout I do influences the amount of sleep I get at night. Each type of workout has varying levels of intensity and yardage, and I am interested in conveying how these factors affect my sleep.

I found Jill Pelto's paintings as inspiration for my work. I wanted to paint a picture with my data, and I tried to do that by making my visualization look like a competition swimming pool.

The form of my work is...

To create my affective visualization, I first explored the artists that were given, and decideded that I wanted to create a painting to represent my data.

# Problem 3. Statistical critique

## a. Revisit and summarize

The main statistical test that the authors use in this paper to test their research question is a Chi-squared analysis. The authors are interested in seeing how different MPA characteristics impact the social well-being of fishing communities. Although I chose to describe the table in Homework 2, I will be critiquing the figure for this assignment, as it shows the results of the Chi-squared test.

![Table 1.](table 1.png)

![Figure 1.](figure 1.png)

## b. Visual clarity

The authors visually represented their statistics using a histogram to depict the frequency of the changes in each social category. On the x axis, they have each of the factors that they used to represent social well being, like food security, resource control, employment, community organization, and income, as well as areas for increase, no change, and decrease for each factor. The y axis is the frequency for the histogram, which in this case is the number of fisher subgroups. Because it is a histogram, there are no summary statistics to display, but they do show the p-value for the results that were statistically significant.

## c. Aesthetic clarity

I think the authors could have made the figure more aesthetically pleasing. The figure was all black and white, and they used different combinations of lines and shades of gray to show the differences in gear, which did make the figure hard to read in my opinion. I would say that the data: ink ratio isn't bad, but the manner in which they chose to show the differences in gear and net types could be clearer. I felt that I wasn't really able to understand fully what was being shown in the figure until I fully read through the Results section.

## d. Recommendations

One recommendation that I would give to the authors of this paper is to take out the social-well being categories that did not have statistically significant results. They could easily explain in the results and discussion section of the paper that due to small sample sizes, some of the factors did not have significant results. In my opinion, taking out these categories and focusing on the ones that did have significant results would make the figure look less cluttered. Another recommendation that I have is to take out the differences in gear, line, and net type from the histogram. While it does show extra layers and dimensions to the results, the point of a histogram is to show frequency distributions, and I felt that adding the gear groups cluttered the figure and made it much harder to read and digest. I think that if the authors really wanted to include that information, they could add another figure to the paper to display those results in a different way.
